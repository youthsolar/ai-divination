# Requesting Code Review

Dispatch a code-reviewer subagent to catch issues before they cascade. The reviewer gets precisely crafted context for evaluation — never your session's history.

**Core principle:** Review early, review often.

## When to Request Review

**Mandatory:**
- After each task in subagent-driven development
- After completing major feature
- Before merge to main

**Optional but valuable:**
- When stuck (fresh perspective)
- Before refactoring (baseline check)
- After fixing complex bug

## How to Request

**1. Get git SHAs:**
```bash
BASE_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD~1)  # or origin/main
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

**2. Dispatch code-reviewer subagent with:**
- `WHAT_WAS_IMPLEMENTED` - What you just built
- `PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS` - What it should do
- `BASE_SHA` and `HEAD_SHA` - Commit range
- `DESCRIPTION` - Brief summary

**3. Act on feedback:**
- Fix Critical issues immediately
- Fix Important issues before proceeding
- Note Minor issues for later
- Push back if reviewer is wrong (with reasoning)

## Integration with Workflows

**Subagent-Driven Development:** Review after EACH task
**Executing Plans:** Review after each batch (3 tasks)
**Ad-Hoc Development:** Review before merge

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Skip review because "it's simple"
- Ignore Critical issues
- Proceed with unfixed Important issues
